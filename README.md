This is my ToDo List from the Odin Project.

It allows the user to read, create, delete and update tasks within projects. It uses webpack and ES6 Imports and exports to separate functionality and create cleaner, more maintainable code.

The project also uses the WebStorage API to save Projects and Tasks created by the User as well as their state/status such that changes are maintained across browsing sessions.
